            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a healthcare worker turned coder! I have worked in healthcare for the past 6 years, and now I am looking to start a new career in programming.
                I love to learn! I am constantly searching for new things to learn and do to keep my mind active. I also love problem solving. 
                I am the go-to person when it comes to figuring out why certain things do not work, and I enjoy taking the time to help others resolve their issues.
                
                Jumping into this field was intimidating at first,but the more I have learned through the Bootcamp, the more exciting all of this has become! 
                It has been quite an exciting journey so far, and I look forward to learning more things as I become more proficient in the coding world!
