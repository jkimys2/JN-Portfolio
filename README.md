# JN-Portfolio

## Description

Through this challenge, I was able to build my portfolio to present information to potential employers. The portfolio contains information about myself, my projects to date, contact information, as well as a resume. This project was accomplished by using the following acceptance criterias as a guideline:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

This challenge has helped me set up an interactive portfolio that makes me stand out while displaying my previous work. Although there is much to be done, I was able to get a head start on my portfolio to present to future employers. This project helped me put my work as well as contact information in one place so that anyone could see my work and contact me if necessary. Through creating this portfolio, I was faced with many challenges, but the end result made it all worthwhile.

I was able to accomplish this challenge through creating HTML and CSS files. I first created the HTML file with all of the information that I wanted to present on the webpage. Once that was completed, the stylesheet as well as the reset CSS files were attached to the HTML file.

## Usage

This project was completed without any starter code. Everything on this page was placed strategically by adjusting the HTML and CSS files. The image below shows how the final product appears:
